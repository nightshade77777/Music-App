# Music-App
A music streaming service that allows a user to stream  music from its song library. 
It collects and stores data about  the users and their listening preferences.
A song library  contains details about each song.

The system allows a user to create playlists (a valid playlist must contain at least one 
song). The system stores each playlist and the user can select a saved playlist to view.
When users sign up, they create an account and must enter their:
• name
• date of birth
• favourite artist
• favourite genre.

The program:
1. Allows a user to create an account, and then input and store their details.
2. Allows a user to edit their favourite artist and favourite genre.
3. Allows a user to display an alphabetical list of the song titles in the song 
library, including the artist and track length for each song title.
4. Allows a user to create, save and view playlists. The play list should contain 
the song title, Artist and Song length.
5. The user inputs a genre (e.g. Pop) and it generates a playlist that contains up 
to five songs for that genre.
6. Allows the user to enter an artist’s name and save all the songs in the song 
library by that artist to a text file.
